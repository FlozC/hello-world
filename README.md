Learning how to use GitHub by going through the GitHub guide

Hi there! I used to code in C and Java, but that was more than 15 years ago. A few months ago I decided to pick up programming again, and I completed a Intro to Programming Nanodegree with Udacity in Feb this year, so I know a little about HTML, CSS, and SQL too. Right now I am taking a data science class at Stanford, and learning to use R.
